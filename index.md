# TIRX: Blackwell Tile-Primitive Programming

TIRX (Tensor IR neXt) is a Python DSL for writing high-performance GPU kernels at the IR level. This tutorial targets Blackwell because its TIRX path exposes tile primitives for TMA tile copies, `tcgen05` MMA, TMEM layouts, mbarriers, and CTA clusters.

TIRX sits between high-level kernel DSLs and raw CUDA/PTX. High-level DSLs are easier to write and often the right tool, but they can hide the exact hardware contract behind scheduling or library choices. Raw CUDA/PTX gives maximum control, but the program becomes descriptor setup, barrier state, layout bookkeeping, and instruction-level plumbing. TIRX is for the middle ground: the kernel still names Blackwell concepts directly, while the compiler can see scope, layout, and dispatch as structured IR instead of scattered intrinsic arguments.

A tile primitive is a structured operation on tile values. Its lowering is controlled by three things:

- **Scope** — which group of threads issues or cooperates on the operation.
- **Layout** — how the operand tiles map to GMEM, SMEM, TMEM, or registers.
- **Dispatch** — which hardware path is intended when there is a choice, such as TMA or `tcgen05`.

For asynchronous primitives, barriers and waits describe the handoff between tile operations.

## Reading Path
