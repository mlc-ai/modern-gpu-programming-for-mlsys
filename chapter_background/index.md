# GPU Execution Model

:::{admonition} Overview
:class: overview

- GPU kernel execution is first shaped by the thread hierarchy: thread, warp, warpgroup, CTA, cluster, and grid each correspond to a different scale of cooperation. Many Blackwell operations have their own natural scope: a TMA copy is launched by a single thread, a TMEM load is carried out by a warpgroup, and a 2-CTA cooperative MMA spans two CTAs.
- Data does not live in just one place. GMEM, SMEM, TMEM, and registers serve different capacity, latency, and access-scope needs; clusters also use DSMEM so one CTA can access another CTA's shared memory. One core task of a high-performance kernel is to move data efficiently between these spaces.
- Compute and data movement are handled by different hardware engines. CUDA cores handle address calculation, control flow, and scalar logic; Tensor Cores perform the main matrix computation; TMA moves data asynchronously. We end the chapter with a GEMM data pipeline that shows how overlap keeps multiple engines busy at the same time.
:::

To write fast GPU programs, it is important to understand the hardware
itself and how code runs on that hardware. This chapter gives an overview of the GPU execution
model: the thread hierarchy that executes the work, the memory spaces that hold and move the data,
and the compute and data-movement engines that do the heavy lifting. We first introduce these
pieces one by one, then put them together in a GEMM pipeline so it is clear how data and execution
flow through the hardware. Nearly every optimization later in the book is some way of arranging
work across those same pieces.

Modern GPUs also contain many specialized hardware units. To give a first taste, the interactive
demo below shows the main elements inside a Blackwell streaming multiprocessor before we zoom in on each
part. You can click into each part to see its details.

## The Execution Hierarchy

We begin with the threads that do the work. A GPU does not present its thousands of threads as one
flat pool. Instead it groups them into a nested hierarchy, and it does so because cooperation happens
at several different scales at once. Each level exists to make cooperation cheap at one of those
scales. The following figure shows the hierarchy on Blackwell; you can click into each level to
highlight it.

```
*Interactive: click a level: thread → warp → warpgroup → CTA → cluster → grid.*

- **Thread**: the scalar unit of execution. Each thread has its own program counter and its own
  registers, and it is identified by a lane ID within its warp.
- **Warp**: 32 threads that execute in SIMT (*single instruction, multiple threads*). The lanes of
  a warp issue the same instruction together, yet each keeps its own registers and can be masked off
  on its own, which is what lets the lanes of a single warp follow different branches.
- **Warpgroup**: four consecutive warps, or 128 threads. Hopper introduced the warpgroup as the
  unit that issues warpgroup-level MMA (`wgmma`), and on Blackwell it takes on a second role: it is
  also the cooperation unit for Tensor Memory access.
- **CTA** (*Cooperative Thread Array*, what CUDA also calls a thread block): the basic unit the
  hardware schedules. A CTA runs on a single SM and owns a private shared-memory allocation inside
  it. Several CTAs can be resident on the same SM at once, and when they are, they divide up that
  SM's shared-memory capacity between them.
- **Cluster**: a group of cooperating CTAs that may live on different SMs. The CTAs in a cluster
  can synchronize with one another and can read and write each other's shared memory, a capability
  known as distributed shared memory.

These levels are worth dwelling on because, unlike on earlier architectures, Blackwell's key
operations are **not all issued by the same group of threads**. A TMA copy is launched by a single
thread and then carried out by hardware. A TMEM-to-register load is warpgroup-distributed: the four
warps cooperate, each moving its own slice of the TMEM tile. A `tcgen05` MMA is committed by one
elected thread, while a clustered MMA spans two CTAs at once. Each operation thus has its own natural granularity, and the set of threads that runs it is
what we call the operation's **scope**, the first of the three recurring design elements (scope, layout, and
dispatch) that this book returns to again and again.

## Memory Spaces

The threads in that hierarchy are only as fast as the data reaching them, so we turn next to where
that data lives. There is no single memory that is at once large and fast; physics forces a trade-off
between capacity and speed. A GPU therefore offers several memories rather than one, each striking that
trade-off at a different point, and a kernel works by moving data through them. Each space has its
own capacity, its own latency, and its own rules for who may access it.

| Memory | Ownership | Role | Notes |
|--------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Global (GMEM)** | Device-wide | Persistent tensor storage | Large HBM, shared by all SMs |
| **Shared (SMEM)** | Per-CTA (one SM) | Tile staging | Low-latency scratchpad; up to 228 KB/SM on B200 |
| **Tensor Memory (TMEM)** | Per-CTA | MMA accumulator storage | New on Blackwell; used by `tcgen05` |
| **Register File (RF)** | Per-thread | Scalars and per-thread tile fragments | Fast; holds epilogue/temp values |

Of the four, **Tensor Memory (TMEM)** is the only one with no analog on pre-Blackwell hardware, and
its full details wait until {ref}`chap_tensor_cores`. The motivation for it is worth understanding
now, though. Earlier GPUs kept large MMA accumulators in registers, where they competed for a scarce
resource. Blackwell instead writes `tcgen05` accumulator output to TMEM, a CTA-scoped 2D scratchpad
of 128 lanes by up to 512 32-bit columns per CTA (the array physically lives on the SM). The kernel
then has to read TMEM back into registers explicitly before the epilogue. That extra step is not
free, and two of its consequences will recur throughout the book. The first is that TMEM reads are
**explicit and warpgroup-distributed**, carried out cooperatively by the four warps of a warpgroup.
The second is that TMEM, unlike registers, must be **explicitly allocated and freed**.

### Distributed Shared Memory Across a Cluster

Most of the levels introduced above are confined to a single SM, while a cluster can place multiple
CTAs on different SMs. This means CTAs can not only synchronize with one another, but also access one
another's shared memory across SMs. This cross-CTA shared-memory access capability is called
**distributed shared memory (DSMEM)**.

DSMEM helps avoid unnecessary round trips through global memory. With DSMEM, one CTA can copy a tile
directly from its own SMEM to another CTA's SMEM in the same cluster, without first writing it back
to GMEM and having the peer CTA read it again. Once the copy completes, hardware raises a completion
barrier to tell later computation that the data is ready.

The 2-CTA cluster GEMM in Part III is built on this mechanism. The two CTAs can share operand tiles
through DSMEM, reducing global memory accesses. Here, "share" does not mean merging the two CTAs'
SMEM into one pool: Asmem and Bsmem still belong to their respective CTAs. DSMEM provides cross-CTA
access, allowing other CTAs in the cluster, or a `cta_group=2` cooperative MMA, to read data from a
peer CTA's SMEM.

The figure below shows the DSMEM access path in a 2-CTA cluster: each CTA still owns its own SMEM,
but it can read another CTA's SMEM through DSMEM.

cluster (DSMEM), and the pair produces a 256×256 output tile.*

## Compute: CUDA Cores and Tensor Cores

The threads and the data they move have to meet at an arithmetic unit, and an SM offers two distinct
kinds of math engine rather than one. The division of labor between the two shapes how nearly every
kernel is written, and they play complementary roles.

- **CUDA cores** are general-purpose SIMT ALUs. They run the scalar and vector instructions that
  handle index arithmetic, elementwise math, reductions, and control flow, the glue logic that
  surrounds the heavy matrix work.
- **Tensor Cores** are fixed-function units that perform a dense matrix multiply-accumulate at *tile*
  granularity, computing $D = AB + C$ in a single instruction.

The reason this split matters is that the Tensor Cores deliver vastly more arithmetic throughput than
the CUDA cores, on the order of 10× or more in FLOP/s, so dense linear algebra (GEMM, convolution,
and attention) reaches peak performance only when it runs on the Tensor Cores. Getting performance is
therefore largely a matter of keeping those Tensor Cores fed. What shifts from one GPU generation to the next is *how* the Tensor Cores are
programmed and *where* their results come to rest. Hopper introduced the asynchronous warpgroup MMA
(`wgmma.mma_async`); Blackwell's fifth-generation Tensor Core, `tcgen05`, places its accumulators in
Tensor Memory instead of registers, and we devote {ref}`chap_tensor_cores` to it.

Clusters extend these engines in two ways that recur throughout the GEMM chapters. **2-CTA cooperative
MMA** lets two CTAs each contribute their SMEM operands to a single, larger Tensor Core MMA tile.
**TMA multicast** lets one load by the data-movement engine deliver the same GMEM tile to several CTAs
at once, eliminating the redundant global traffic that separate loads would otherwise incur. Both
build on the distributed shared memory introduced earlier.

## The GEMM Data Pipeline

So far we have introduced the hardware units individually. To see how they work together, we can
use a typical general-purpose matrix multiplication (GEMM) pipeline as an example. The
interactive demo below shows the units involved in a three-stage GEMM tile pipeline; click an action
such as `tma load` to highlight the data path it takes across the hardware units.

</div>
```
*Interactive: the load → MMA → epilogue pipeline on Blackwell; click an action to trace its data path across the hardware units.*

A single GEMM tile flows through three stages.

1. **Load.** A TMA copy streams an A or B operand tile from GMEM into SMEM. One
   thread issues the copy, recording up front how many bytes are expected to arrive. As the bytes
   land, the TMA engine reports their progress, and a completion barrier flips only once all the
   expected bytes have been delivered.
2. **Compute.** A `tcgen05` MMA reads the operand tiles out of SMEM and
   accumulates the product into a TMEM tile. One elected thread issues it, and it signals a barrier
   when the math is done.
3. **Epilogue.** The warpgroup reads the TMEM accumulator back into registers, casts the result to
   the output dtype, and stores it to GMEM, frequently by staging through SMEM and issuing a TMA
   store.

Written out this way the three stages look strictly sequential, but the whole difference between a
slow kernel and a fast one lies in **overlap**. A naive kernel really does run the steps in
order (load, wait, compute, wait, store), and so leaves each engine sitting idle while it waits on
the one before it. A fast kernel pipelines them instead: while the Tensor Core is computing on tile
`k`, the TMA engine is already fetching tile `k+1`, and the epilogue is busy draining tile `k-1`, so
all three engines stay occupied at the same time. Getting three asynchronous engines to hand work off
to one another safely is precisely the job of the barrier and phase model, and the GEMM ladder of
Part III is built on top of it.
